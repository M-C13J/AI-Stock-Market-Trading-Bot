This project utilises a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices and simulates trading based on these predictions using Streamlit for an interactive interface.

## Features

- **Stock Price Prediction**: Uses a pre-trained LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
- **Trading Simulation**: Simulates trading by applying predicted stock prices with configurable trading parameters.
- **Interactive Visualisations**: Provides visual feedback on stock price predictions and trading outcomes.
